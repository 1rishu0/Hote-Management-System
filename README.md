# Hote-Management-System
I developed a hotel management system using Java Core and Swing for the user interface. I utilized JDBC to connect to a MySQL database for data management. The system allows for functionalities like room booking, availability checks, and customer management, enhancing the efficiency of hotel operations.

##  **Overview of the Hotel Management System**
A Hotel Management System (HMS) is designed to manage the day-to-day operations of a hotel. It typically includes functionalities for handling reservations, room management, guest check-ins and check-outs, billing, and reporting. The system should provide an easy-to-use interface for hotel staff and administrators.

## **Key Features**
**User Authentication:**
- Login functionality for staff and administrators.
- Role-based access control to different features based on user roles (e.g., receptionist, manager).

**Room Management:**
- Add, update, and delete room details (type, number, price, availability).
- View all rooms in a table format with filtering options.

**Reservation Management:**
- Create, update, and cancel reservations.
- Check room availability and book rooms based on user selection.
- Search functionality based on criteria like date range and room type.

## **Technology Stack**

**Java Core:** The primary programming language used to build the application logic and data handling.

**Swing:** The graphical user interface (GUI) toolkit for building the application's front end. It allows for creating windows, buttons, forms, and other UI components.

**JDBC (Java Database Connectivity):** Used to connect and interact with the MySQL database. JDBC allows the application to execute SQL queries and retrieve results from the database.

**MySQL:** The relational database management system used to store all hotel data, including user accounts, room details, reservations, and billing information.

## **Conclusion**
Developing a Hotel Management System using Java Core, Swing, JDBC, and MySQL is an excellent project that integrates various programming skills and concepts. It allows for a practical application of database management, GUI design, and core Java programming principles. This project can serve as a valuable addition to your portfolio and provide hands-on experience with real-world applications.
